# Tasks: Add Console Logs to Entry Points

## Objective
Add console log statements to every MFE entry point file that logs when the MFE object has been added to the window.

## Task Checklist

- [x] Add console log to common-header/src/main.jsx when window.HeaderMFE is added
- [x] Add console log to common-footer/src/main.jsx when window.FooterMFE is added
- [x] Add console log to dashboard-sidebar/src/main.jsx when window.DashboardSidebarMFE is added
- [x] Add console log to hotlists-sidebar/src/main.jsx when window.HotlistsSidebarMFE is added
- [x] Add console log to hotlists-dashboard/src/main.jsx when window.HotlistsDashboardMFE is added
- [x] Verify mfe-shell/src/app-shell.js has appropriate initialization log (already exists)

**Note:** dashboard-landing/src/main.ts already has initialization log at line 39.
